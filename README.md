## Project Description
***
**Kilbronogue trip** is my first out of four milestone projects at the Code Institute 
Full Stack Developer course.
The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum
of 3 pages using HTML5 and CSS3, along with any other technologies I wanted to use.

The choice of the first milestone's subject took me a lot of time. I spent hours trying to figure out what 
would make me happy to write about, subject I have enough materials (information and photos) about,
and finally, the overall structure what my project will have in order to represent the best my intentions - to demonstrate
my time in Kilbronogue, in West Cork, where I spent lovely several months of my life during Irish lock-down in 2020.




##  User Experience
***

In this paragraph I'm about to provide insight into my UX process, 
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve 
and how my project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

According to [interaction design page](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design), user 
experience (UX) design is _"the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant 
experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, 
including aspects of branding, design, usability and function."_

I wanted to make my project useful, usable and valuable.
I made the website for the users interested in West Cork and its activities. 


### Project Goals

- to create a website that is fully responsive on mobiles, laptops, tablets and desktops,
- to make a page with interface design, providing a logical structure easy to follow,
- to get people interested to visit West Cork and to discover surrounding places,
- to learn about these places, their history and history of Ireland in general and to get
the users familiar with it,
- to name the activities I did while staying in Kilbronogue,
- to have all the beautiful pictures I took in Kilbronogue on one web site, easily 
accessible to me and other users interested in subject.


### The business goals of this website is:

- to build touristic awareness of West Cork 

### User Stories

- as a new user, I want to get familiar with possible activities in West Cork during lockdown.
- as a user who likes to travel, I want to know more about Kilbronogue, to locate it on the map
and have access to accommodation information as well as photos taken there.
- as a user who is on vacation in West Cork, I want to be able to read other people's story who lived there and 
explore the places that are close to me so that I can see as much as possible.
- as a user living in Ireland, I want a destination to visit during the weekend and a place to take a snack and beverage.
- as a user interested in history, I want to learn about Irish history for which I could as well use the links provided in the page.

## Strategy

The main goal of the website is to attract users interested in West Cork, its history (and history of Ireland)
and to mention possible activites a person can do during their stay in Kilbronogue. My personal goal was to 
create a website as a memory of my Kilbronogue trip and to have all the pictures I took in one place (one web site).
My goal in design was to make everything as structured and intuitive as possible with the interactivity 
of text and images making the UX simple and easy to read.

There is only English version of the website. Since my website doesn't have particular
social links (Fb, Instagram, Twitter...), the ones provided are linked to  general pages about history of 
Ireland or some particular location in Ireland.

## Scope
I wanted to represent myself so that the users can have an idea of the creator of the page.
I wanted to show to users the beauty of Kilbornogue and West Cork, its itineraries and
possible indoor activites they can do if they decide to travel to West Cork. 

## Structure
All the pages have a fixed **navbar** with "Kilbronogue trip" logo I created just for the 
purpose of the page.

At the bottom of the page I put a **footer** with social links and copyright text.

* First - _Home_ page, has a jumbotron with the quote in it, followed by "About me" section which
is, again, followed by some activites photos with text. 
* Second - _Gallery_ page, is separated in three divs, each one containing photos
with different subjects. _Nature_, _With animals_ and _Food we made_. I colored the last div's
background differently on purpose, in order to divide it semantically from the first two divs which both represent
nature (flora or fauna). To reduce the width of the page and to make it more structured and nicer, I introduced 
_overflow_ element.
* In the third - _Accommodation_ page, I introduced _form_ and _map_ section and it's 
the only page that has _table_, so it's a bit more diverse. I decided to put more 
history text, strongly related to Kilbronogue place and which might
attract people in coming to Ireland and visit West Cork.

## Skeleton
##### Wireframe
By using Balsamiq, I developed the wireframes for each page, for mobile, tablet and laptop/desktop size.
I added the colours in the next step and coloured the background of some sections.

You can click on one of the following links below:

[LARGE SIZE wireframe](https://gillem.github.io/Kilbronogue_trip/assets/wireframes/Wireframe_large_screen.html)

[MEDIUM SIZE wireframe](https://gillem.github.io/Kilbronogue_trip/assets/wireframes/Wireframe_medium_screen.html)

[EXTRA-SMALL wireframe](https://gillem.github.io/Kilbronogue_trip/assets/wireframes/Wireframe_extra_small_screen.html)

## Surface
After finishing with the Skeleton plane of user experience, I started with 
the Surface plan, the most concrete plan of all five of them. 
I tried to accomplish the following tasks: how can the users interact, what effects are there,
 what they can click, where they can go to, and also the final version of the 
 information that appears on the screen.

I wanted to provide readability and make my content legible.
I also try to have consistent patterns, e.x. the navbar and header section 
and the footer section are consistent across the pages, while for the bigger text
I decided to go with the font that contains the lowercase as well, which the main font
doesn't provide.
I used the form, map, buttons and table. In phone responsiveness, I decided to remove the 
last column to make UX more legible.


##### Colour Scheme

I used _Google inspect_ feature to choose the colours that would fit the page and match
together, paying attention between the contrast of the background color and the text
in order to make it more legible.
I decided to use mostly greyish and white colours with some dark red and dark blue.
The footer dark red colours matches with font colour in the navbar. Social links are white
which also mathes the navigation background as well as some section's background in the 
pages. The reason for choosing dark blue background of the last div sections was
the bluish and dark (opaque overlayed) background picture in _Home_ 
and _Accommodation_ page.

##### Typography

The _Amatic SC, cursive_ font is the main font used throughout the website with _Sans Serif_
as the fall-back font in case if for any reason the primary font isn't being imported into the site.
I used it for navbar, headings, jumbotron and divs which don't contain to much text.
I used the _Roboto_ font for the larger group of texts, with _Sans Serif_
as the fall-back.

##### Imagery

I used transition to each activity section containing header, text and image in the _Home_ page.

The majority of photographs are taken by me during my stay in Kilbronogue.
The ones I was missing, like norwegian mythology photo I took from [Unsplash site](https://www.lifeinnorway.net/norwegian-mythology-folk-tales/) 
and accommodation background photo I found on very gifted illustrator's Laivi Põder [page](https://www.instagram.com/laivi_illustration/?hl=en)

I also designed my own logo for the website myself through [The Canva](https://www.canva.com/tools/logo-maker-q1/?utm_source=google_sem&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier2_EM&utm_term=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier2_Logo%20Maker_EM&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQiA48j9BRC-ARIsAMQu3WQ7ydQ2Q3Kda5FdSQv4VHsPLO8MA73UXXeadtTRhM33HDo8yivlf6MaAnemEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

I chose the divider image from [Freepek page](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/ornaments-collection-design-concept_3463268.htm).

In order to inverse the colours from black to white, I used [Pinetools editor](https://pinetools.com/invert-image-colors).
I also made the background transparent by using [removebg site](https://www.remove.bg/).



## Features
***

The project consists of three different pages, all of which can be accessed through the menu in the navbar.

**Consistent features across all pages:**

-	The fixed navbar containing the menu at the top of the page is consistent and across all pages.
-	The sticky footer is consistent across all pages.
-	The navbar's and the footer's colour is consistent in each page, always containing the same elements.
-	Each page has a footer with copyright information and social media icons linking to diferrent page of the respective media.
-   I introduced "Top up" button which can be find in the right bottom of each page and it
leads to navigation bar which makes the scrolling easier for each user.


### Features left to Implement

In the future, I would like:
* to add the links to the right social networks, because now the pages of the various social networks do not yet exist.
* add more places to visit in West Cork.
* add the option to choose the language of the website.



## Technologies used
***

**Languages, libraries, frameworks, editors and version control**

* HTML5
  * The language used to create the form and add content to the website.
* CSS3
  * The language used to style the HTML5 elements.
* [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * The project uses **Bootstrap4** to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive easily.
  * The project also uses BootstrapCDN to provide icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
  * I used Gitpod's development environment to write the code for the website
* [Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/)
  * I used Git for Version Control to record changes and updates to my files
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * I used GitHub’s repository hosting service to host my deployed website as well as track previous versions of my code 

**Other tools used:**

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
  * I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for my project for large, medium and extra-small views.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
  - It was helpful with all my HTML, CSS and Bootstrap issues.

*Note: I also found [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) helpful resource throughout the project, 
providing me information related to HMTL, CSS, Bootstrap and sometime even JavaScript which
wasn't required in this project. 

I cannot emphasize enough the importance of **Code Institute Slack Community** and their desire to help . 
I got response in 100% of the cases and that helped me to proceed with the lessons
and it gave me a huge boost of confidence. This platform is very useful and friendly oriented.


## Testing
***

**General Testing**

* Tested all external links opened in a new tab and went to the correct page
* Tested all internal links within the pages.
* Tested all buttons.
* Tested the responsive behaviour of images and text on desktops, laptops, notebooks and various smartphones.
* Reduce and expand width of window to verify that each line of text behaves the way expected, 
and that the text arrangement looks good on all devices sizes.
* I identified and fixed majority of problems that were affecting my sites' performance, accessibility 
and UX by using open-source Google tool **Lighthouse**. A day before submitting the milestone, performance of
each one page exceeds 80%.

**Navbar**

- Click on each navigation menu item and verify that it links to the correct page.
- Hover over navigation links and see the difference in colour.
- Click on one navigation link and see how the colour of active link is different.
- Change the screen sizes to verify that the navigation bar is responsive and switches 
from in line menu to navbar toggler button with dropdown menu at the appropriate place.
- Tested the picture logo in all devices' sizes and it's well positioned.

**Map**

The map's div is fixed and the map is flexibile inside the div and can be move to different directions. 

- Pres _minimize and maximize button_ on the map to expand and reduce the scale. 
- Press _View larger _map_ to see that the map opens in the new tab. 
- Press _Satelite imagery_ to see that it works both, in the page and in the larger view.
- Press _Street map_ again to see that it changes back to street view is made.

**Form contact**

- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
- Reduce and expand width of window to verify that the form display behaves and centres the way expected, 
and that is well positioned on all devices' size.

**Footer**

- Hover over each social media icon and confirm the different colour of the icon.
- Click on each icon to confirm it opens a separate tab for its link.
- Reduce and expand width of the window to verify that the footer is responsive and that
is well positioned on all devices' size.


## Validation
***
I used **W3C CSS Validation Service** and **W3C Markup Validation Service** to check the validity of the website code.
The validator showed just one error and it's in the _gallery.html_ page.
It says that there is _src_ attribute missing from modal image. Every image in the _gallery.html_
has the _src_ and _alt_ attribute, but since this modal serves to open each image from the gallery and to make it bigger,
it wasn't possible to give a name to its source. Not taking in consideration this fact,
all the pages, as well as the CSS page, passed validation test which can be verified by clicking on the following links:

- W3C CSS validation - [CSS page](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgillem.github.io%2FKilbronogue_trip%2Fassets%2Fcss%2Fstyle.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
- W3C Markup Validation - [Home page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgillem.github.io%2FKilbronogue_trip%2Findex.html)
- W3C Markup Validation - [Gallery page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgillem.github.io%2FKilbronogue_trip%2Fgallery.html)
- W3C Markup Validation - [Accommodation page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgillem.github.io%2FKilbronogue_trip%2Faccommodation.html)


To test phone responsiveness of each page, I  used [Mobile friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).
All the three pages passed the test which can be checked by clicking on the following links: [Home page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=HAcf9Qzh05MQltbkZByFNw),
 [Gallery page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=zG1pGL1AnIlVCmg_60pdeA) and [Accommodation page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=z5TcQNYJ91LtQ_hYvbzB1A)
